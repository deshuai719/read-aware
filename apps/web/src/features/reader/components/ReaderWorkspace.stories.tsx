/**
 * The reader shell around an open book.
 *
 * With a `readerSource` it mounts the foliate engine, which needs a real
 * parsed book and the vendored engine tree — neither of which exists outside
 * the app, so these stories deliberately cover the states where there is no
 * source yet: opening, and every way opening can fail.
 *
 * Those failure states are worth the attention. The recovery offered depends on
 * *why* the file is missing: a transient fetch can be retried, but a file the
 * relay never held needs the original back instead — re-importing it heals the
 * book in place through the sha dedup gate. Getting that branch wrong sends
 * readers in a circle.
