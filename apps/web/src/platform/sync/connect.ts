/**
 * The account-connect flow (docs/sync-engine.md §5, §9), in TWO phases with a
 * user-facing boundary between them:
 *
 *  1. `verifySignInToken` — redeem the one-time token. Returns WHICH account
 *     it opened (`email`) alongside the session. Burning the token here is
 *     fine: the sign-in email/OAuth page is still valid to re-request.
 *  2. `establishEncryption` — passphrase → master key, verified against (or
 *     published as) the account's key material.
 *
 * The boundary is the login-CSRF defense: a sign-in token can be delivered by
 * a THIRD PARTY (a deep link from any web page, a pasted "code"), so the UI
 * must show the account email between the phases — before, never after, the
 * user is asked for the encryption passphrase. A token for an attacker's
 * account must not be connectable while looking like "just finish signing
 * in": once the passphrase lands, this device's whole library adopts that
 * account. `establishEncryption` therefore takes the verification from phase
 * 1 as a parameter — there is no way to call it without having had the email
 * in hand.
 *
 * Pure orchestration over an injected relay client and KDF, so the whole flow
 * — including the publish race between two first devices — runs under bun:test.
