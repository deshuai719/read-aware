//! Event → projection application: the "apply" half of event sourcing.
//!
//! Until this module existed the projections (books/collections/annotations/…)
//! were written DIRECTLY by the frontend and the event log was a best-effort
//! side-car appended next to them. That made the log unreplayable: nothing
//! could turn `domain_events` back into the tables the app reads, so the log
//! could drift from the projections with no way to detect or repair it.
//!
//! `apply_event` is now the ONLY thing that writes a projection row. Two
//! callers share it, which is what makes the log authoritative:
//!
//!   - `commit_events` — the live write path. Append + apply run in ONE
//!     transaction, so an event and the row it implies land together or not
//!     at all.
//!   - `rebuild_projections` — wipes the derived tables and replays the whole
//!     log through the same function. Also backs `verify_projections`, which
//!     replays into scratch tables and diffs against the live ones.
//!
//! Rules every arm here follows:
//!   - **Idempotent.** Upsert or delete; never blind INSERT, never read-modify-
//!     write in Rust. Replaying the same event twice must be a no-op. The one
//!     accumulating projection (reading_time) is protected upstream instead:
//!     `commit_events` only applies events the log actually accepted as new.
//!   - **Order-tolerant.** A mutation for a row that does not exist is a silent
//!     no-op (`UPDATE … WHERE id = ?`), not an error — a book with no
//!     `book.imported` should not exist, and rebuild must reach that same state.
//!   - **Forward-compatible.** An unknown event type is ignored, so a log
//!     written by a newer build still replays on an older one.
//!
//! Two axes stay separate, and this module only owns one of them:
//!   - **Domain facts** (title, author, progress, highlights, memories) are
//!     event-sourced. That is everything below.
//!   - **Book content** — the original file and anything extracted from it
//!     (covers) — travels as a blob through object storage, never through the
//!     log. `book.coverExtracted` records that an extraction produced a
//!     `cover:` blob (so other devices fetch the artwork instead of
//!     re-parsing a book they may not hold), but the event applies to no
//!     projection column: `books.cover_url` / `cover_checked` are a LOCAL
//!     DERIVED CACHE materialized from that blob on each device, preserved
//!     by rebuild (see `rebuild_projections`).
//!
//! `profile.updated` / `entity.*` likewise apply to nothing: they are accepted
//! into the log, but the consolidation pipeline that would own their projection
//! is not built yet.
